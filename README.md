# **Introduction**

**What:** Rainbows End Sex Tech Hackathon is an online event organised by Creative Coding Utrecht, [Touchy-Feely Tech](https://www.instagram.com/touchyfeelytech/) and Creative Coding Amsterdam. This mini-hackathon will explore the diverse and evolving field of Sex Tech and its impact on the past, present, and future of intimacy, companionship, and human behaviour. You can expect talks, workshops and demos, the chance to learn something new and plenty of opportunities to connect with fellow Sex Tech Hackers.

**When:** 9:30am - 18:00pm CET Saturday January 23rd and 10:00am - 3pm CET Sunday January 24th, 2021.

**Cost:** €30,- / Students: €15,-

**Who is it for?:** We invite all artists, academics, technologists, thinkers and tinkerers from all backgrounds and perspectives to take part in this fast-paced event (no previous skills necessary!). The event is open to anyone who is interested to explore themes that could include, but are not limited to: Intimacy in the digital age, remoteness, non-binary design approaches, embodiment in virtual or augmented reality, decolonizing sexual health, and modern approaches to sex education.

# **Pre-Hackathon preparations**

## Things to do before the event**

[ x ] Agree to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/touchyfeelytech/sex-tech-hackathon/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)  
[ x ] Introduce yourself on the [introductions doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MU5UgJ7BUryLbj1cE-3zsQH3TvfaMQv5D5IvjGIL7I4/edit)  
[ x ] Have a brief idea of the [challenge](https://github.com/touchyfeelytech/sex-tech-hackathon/blob/main/README.md#challenges) you'd like to work on - this will leave more time for development on the day!  
[ x ] Order any tools or materials you might like to use ahead of time

## Finding a team

It's fine to create a solo project, but we want to provide a setting that encourages teamwork and a fruitful exchange of ideas.

We have created an introductions document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MU5UgJ7BUryLbj1cE-3zsQH3TvfaMQv5D5IvjGIL7I4/edit?usp=sharing) for networking before the event. When you purchase a ticket, you will be invited to the document ([let us know](mailto:hello@touchyfeely.tech) if you haven't been added yet). Feel free to introduce yourself there to get to know other attendees ahead of time.  

If you want to collaborate with others, there will be opportunities on the day to mingle, share ideas and form teams.  

## Event structure

Day 1: After introducing the event and its challenges, we will provide opportunities to mingle and form teams. The rest of the day will be split up into three “sprints”, with talks and breaks scheduled throughout. The sprints will be guided by mentors with experience of previous Sex Tech Hackathons, and are there to support your idea generation, prototyping, and pitch building activities.  

Day 2: Time for working on projects followed by an afternoon pitch session in front of a judging panel. There are prizes to be won!  

A full schedule of the event will be announced soon.  

## Challenges

The Hackathon invites participants to conceptualise and/or build projects that respond to our proposed challenges: Remoteness, Fair Futures and Sex(Tech) Education.

### Remoteness

In the last year, more than ever, we have found ourselves "[alone together](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8694125-alone-together)". How can technology remedy the effects of our isolation, and facilitate intimacy between humans, machines or virtual entities who are remote? On the flip-side, can our improved literacy in cyberspace open up new or experimental forms of intimacy and companionship?

### Fair futures

The (Sex) tech we use should be as multifaceted as its users, but it doesn't currently reflect the wide spectrum of human identities, imaginations or bodies we all have or are capable of having. The homogenising nature of technology and its promise to optimise everything (including our pleasure) can be exclusionary and drastically narrow our experience. How can Sex Tech embrace diversity, inclusion and intersectionality to ensure fair technological futures?

### Sex(Tech) Education

**Sexual health is health**, and a good sex education is directly correlated with better overall health and wellbeing. Despite this, Sex Ed at school level is often outdated, underfunded and sometimes even nonexistent. Taboo and stigma prevail across this field and the challenges faced vary from culture to culture. How can technology create opportunities for new formats that focus on improving sexual health, wellness and body literacy?

## **Kits**

*Please note: You don't need a kit, or any technical background to participate! The judging criteria will take into account the virtual format and the fact that most participants will have limited access to resources.*

We have prepared a limited number of kits that are aimed at beginners who have little prior experience with electronics and making and offer basic supplies to learn, get hands-on, and play with simple electronics. 

If you are located outside of the Netherlands, we are limited by cost and time limitations on top of extra COVID-19 related delays. You have two choices: order a kit from us, or source the parts locally yourself.

  <summary>Want us to ship you a kit?</summary>
  
### **If you are in the Netherlands**

Please confirm your address with us as soon as possible so we can ship you a kit with PostNL.

### **If you are outside of the Netherlands**

Before choosing whether you are interested in receiving a kit, please take note of the following information. If you are interested, please confirm your address and understanding of the above with us as soon as possible!

**International Shipping**We plan to ship the kits 7 working days before the event. The list of average delivery times for our chosen shipping method (International Parcel with Track and Trace / Pakket met Track & Trace) can be found [here](https://www.postnl.nl/en/customer-service/international-delivery-times-post-and-parcels/).

As each country has a different situation, we cannot take responsibility for your parcel arriving on time due to unexpected delays. Please check PostNL's updated international delays [here](https://github.com/touchyfeelytech/sex-tech-hackathon/blob/main/postnl.nl/isa) to estimate the likelihood of your kit arriving on time.

**International Costs**If you choose to order a kit, we ask for an extra charge to cover the cost of shipping and tracking. This cost ranges per country, so please contact us directly with your location if you are interested in a kit, and we will provide more information.

  <summary>Want to source your own kit?</summary>
  
## **Source your own kit**

Feel free to contact [hello@touchyfeely.tech](mailto:hello@touchyfeely.tech) with any questions about sourcing your own materials.

The parts in our kit are common and likely to be in stock at your local electronics supplier. We have marked the most important components above with an asterisk*. These are also the most common parts found in a standard vibrator, so feel free to [tear down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_teardown) an old device instead! The only difference if you source your own parts is that you won't receive a custom printed circuit board to connect the circuit together. We therefore advise that you order extra parts to connect the circuit:

- Wire (any works, but stranded core and 22AWG is a worthy option).
- Wire strippers (a craft blade can also be used as a more fiddly alternative if you are on a limited budget).
- A soldering iron and solder, or solderless connectors ([spring](https://www.dennisdeal.com/products/3-pins-snelle-fix-insteek-clip-spring-connector-kabelklemblok-voor-3528-5050-led-strip_1162333?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gss) or [screw](https://nl.rs-online.com/web/p/terminal-block-accessories/8596348/?cm_mmc=NL-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-CSS_NL_NL_Connectors_Whoop-_-(NL:Whoop%21)+Terminal+Block+Accessories-_-8596348&matchtype=&pla-338696525466&gclid=CjwKCAiA_9r_BRBZEiwAHZ_v15zVulzSnLlZqZr6B-hEcQ0c-MDDumpBMHds1yUEEziz1U5sHXJYOxoCnVUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)).
- [Electrical tape](https://www.allekabels.nl/tape/29/1046572/isolatie-tape.html?gclid=CjwKCAiA_9r_BRBZEiwAHZ_v10IDDsO9NEUf0bll5lGre-KWrFX1PwAnggf09Og4K_24K4GGAO16XhoCyS0QAvD_BwE) (or any tape is fine).
