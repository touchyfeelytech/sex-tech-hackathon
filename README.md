# **Pre-Hackathon preparations**

## Before the event

[ x ] [Join the Touchy-Feely Tech Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Gq4Trqb5jW)  
[ x ] Agree to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/touchyfeelytech/sex-tech-hackathon/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)  
[ x ] Save the dates of our pre-event networking evening on **Thursday the 29th of April** and the Sex Tech Talk Show on **Friday the 30th**.  
[ x ] Read through this page to familiarise yourself with the event's flow and structure  
[ x ] Order any tools or materials you might like to use ahead of time

## Finding a team

It's fine to create a solo project, but we want to provide a setting that encourages teamwork and a fruitful exchange of ideas.

In addition to the networking event on the 29th, we have created a Discord channel for introductions and finding a team. When you purchase a ticket, you will be invited to the Discord server ([let us know](mailto:hello@touchyfeely.tech) if you haven't been added yet). Feel free to introduce yourself there to get to know other attendees ahead of time.  

## Event structure

Day 1: After introducing the event and its challenges, we will provide opportunities to mingle and form teams. The rest of the day will be split up into three ‚Äúsprints‚Äù, with talks and breaks scheduled throughout. The sprints will be guided by mentors with experience of previous Sex Tech Hackathons, and are there to support your idea generation, prototyping, and pitch building activities.  

Day 2: Time for working on projects followed by an afternoon pitch session in front of a judging panel. There are prizes to be won!  

## Activities

Aside from our sprint sessions, we have lined up a bunch of opportunities to learn about the Sex Tech industry and the skills you need to get started as a Sex Tech Maker!  

**Talks:**  
History of Sex Tech with [Oli Lipski](https://twitter.com/lipskioli)  
Getting a job in Sex Tech Q&A with [Bryony Cole](https://twitter.com/bryonycole) ([futureofsex.org](futureofsex.org))  
Sex Tech Trends & Pitching Tips with Lex Gillon ([Modality Group](https://www.modalitygroup.co/))  

**Workshops & Demos:**  
Intro to Open Source / DIY Sex Tech + Tear-down with [Kinky Makers](https://kinkymakers.com/) and [Research + Desire](http://researchanddesire.com/)  
Silicone Casting for Sex Tech with Laura Lytle ([Inside Sex Toys](https://insidesextoys.com/))  
Making and Coding for Intimate Technologies with [Arnab Chakravarty](http://www.arnabchakravarty.com/)  

## Project outcomes

As this is a remote event with both beginners and seasoned Hackers attending, we understand that some people will have limited access to skills or resources. We are therefore ensuring the judging criteria reflects this, and welcome all sorts of interpretations of our challenges.
Here are a range of examples of what a project could be:
- A drawing
- A plan
- A toolkit of ideas
- A collage of images and icons
- A no-code website or app (see our no-code platform examples [here](https://github.com/touchyfeelytech/sex-tech-hackathon#prototyping-tools-and-materials))
- A miniature prototype using clay
- A simple circuit

## Challenges

The Hackathon invites participants to conceptualise and/or build projects that respond to our proposed challenges: FAIR FUTURES, SEXUAL HEALTH = HEALTH and DREAM DEVICES.  

### Fair Futures

As the Sex Tech industry grows, how can we make sure its offerings are accessible to and representative of the wide spectrum of different bodies, identities, imaginations, backgrounds, cultures and contexts that exist here on Earth? How might we develop and distribute tools, experiences or education that actively serve the underserved, and help to destigmatize, decolonize or depatriarchalize the tech industry? This track is focused on the importance of user-centered design in the development of Sex Tech.  

### Sexual Health = Health

Recent studies have shown us that sexual health is a reliable barometer for overall health (did you know that someone tracked their recovery from a brain injury with their smart vibrator?). Focusing on pleasure and intimacy is a powerful way to improve our understanding of the complex link between our body and mind. Can sex or intimate technologies be practical or educational tools for self-literacy, self-regulation or self-care? This track is focused on the meaningful purpose of Sex Tech and its therapeutic potential.

### Dream Devices

As technology becomes smarter, more powerful and increasingly closer to our bodies, how (or when) might Sex Tech become a way to extend, augment or enhance the human body and mind beyond limits? How might Sex Tech play a part in breaking convention around what it is to be human, what it is to be sexual, what it is to be "present", and address the historic and cultural shifts that face us on the horizon? This track seeks to speculate on the evolution of Sex Tech into the not-so-distant future.

During this workshop, Laura will lead us from digital design to a physical object cast in silicone. Materials are not compulsory for this, but if you‚Äôd like to follow along, bring something you‚Äôd like to make a mold of, some mixing cups, a mixing stick, and some silicone: Laura recommends some Smooth-On Dragon Skin 10 NV for your final silicone part and some Smooth-On Dragon Skin 30 for the mold itself.
