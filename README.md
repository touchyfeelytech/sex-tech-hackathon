# Introduction

**What:** Rainbows End Sex Tech Hackathon is an online event organised by Creative Coding Utrecht, [Touchy-Feely Tech](https://www.instagram.com/touchyfeelytech/) and Creative Coding Amsterdam. This mini-hackathon will explore the diverse and evolving field of Sex Tech and its impact on the past, present, and future of intimacy, companionship, and human behaviour. You can expect talks, workshops and demos, the chance to learn something new and plenty of opportunities to connect with fellow Sex Tech Hackers.

**When:** 9:30am - 18:00pm CET Saturday January 23rd and 10:00am - 3pm CET Sunday January 24th, 2021.

**Cost:** â‚¬30,- / Students: â‚¬15,-

**Who is it for?:** We invite all artists, academics, technologists, thinkers and tinkerers from all backgrounds and perspectives to take part in this fast-paced event (no previous skills necessary!). The event is open to anyone who is interested to explore themes that could include, but are not limited to: Intimacy in the digital age, remoteness, non-binary design approaches, embodiment, decolonizing sexual health, and modern approaches to sex education.

We will announce speakers and a full schedule of the event soon - watch this space!

# Pre-Hackathon preparations

## Before the event: To-do list

[ x ]  Make sure you've ordered your ticket  
[ x ]  Read our Code of Conduct (TBA)  
[ x ]  Introduce yourself, your requests to join a team or offerings (if applicable) on the [bulletin board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MU5UgJ7BUryLbj1cE-3zsQH3TvfaMQv5D5IvjGIL7I4)  
[ x ]  Have a brief idea (at least) of something you'd like to work on - tthis will leave more time for development and making on the day!  
[ x ]  Order any tools or materials you'd like to use ahead of time

## Kits

We have prepared a simple kit to help with the prototyping and making process. The kits are aimed at beginners who have little prior experience with electronics and making and want to learn the basics. You don't need a kit to participate! Read on for a list of components included in the kit if you would like to source them locally yourself.

We originally expected most of the attendees to be based in the Netherlands, but due to our virtual format this has become a global event! If you are outside of the Netherlands, due to shipping logistics, we are limited by cost and time limitations on top of COVID-19 related delays. Please read on if you are interested in receiving a kit!

**If you are in the Netherlands:**  
Please confirm your address with us as soon as possible so we can ship you a kit with PostNL.

**If you are outside of the Netherlands:**  
Before choosing whether you are interested in receiving a kit, please take note of the following information. If you are interested, please confirm your address and understanding of the above with us as soon as possible!

**International Shipping**  
We plan to ship the kits 7 working days before the event. The list of average delivery times for our chosen shipping method (International Parcel with Track and Trace / Pakket met Track & Trace) can be found here. As each country has a different situation, we cannot take responsibility for your parcel arriving on time due to unexpected delays. Please check PostNL's updated international delays here to estimate the likelihood of your kit arriving on time.

**International Costs**  
If you choose to order a kit, we ask for an extra charge to cover the cost of shipping and tracking. This cost ranges per country. Please check the cost using [this PostNL tool](https://www.postnl.nl/tarieven/Pakket/LU/0-350g) (choose Pakket, 0-350g). The site is only available in Dutch, so you might have to translate the name of your country with a [translation tool](https://translate.google.com/).

If you would like a faster international service, please refer to PostNL's [International Express](https://www.postnl.nl/en/mail-and-parcels/parcels/international-express/) page to calculate the costs.

## Source your own kit

Feel free to contact [hello@touchyfeely.tech](mailto:hello@touchyfeely.tech) with any questions about sourcing your own materials.

The parts in our kit are common and likely to be in stock at your local electronics supplier. We have marked the most important components above with an asterisk*. These are also the most common parts found in a standard vibrator, so feel free to tear down an old device instead! The only difference if you source your own parts is that you won't receive a custom printed circuit board to connect the circuit together. We therefore advise that you order extra parts to connect the circuit:

- Wire (any works, but stranded core and 22AWG is a worthy option).  
- Wire strippers (a craft blade can also be used as a more fiddly alternative if you are on a limited budget).  
- A soldering iron and solder, or solderless connectors ([spring](https://www.dennisdeal.com/products/3-pins-snelle-fix-insteek-clip-spring-connector-kabelklemblok-voor-3528-5050-led-strip_1162333?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gss) or [screw](https://nl.rs-online.com/web/p/terminal-block-accessories/8596348/?cm_mmc=NL-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-CSS_NL_NL_Connectors_Whoop-_-(NL:Whoop%21)+Terminal+Block+Accessories-_-8596348&matchtype=&pla-338696525466&gclid=CjwKCAiA_9r_BRBZEiwAHZ_v15zVulzSnLlZqZr6B-hEcQ0c-MDDumpBMHds1yUEEziz1U5sHXJYOxoCnVUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)).  
- [Electrical tape](https://www.allekabels.nl/tape/29/1046572/isolatie-tape.html?gclid=CjwKCAiA_9r_BRBZEiwAHZ_v10IDDsO9NEUf0bll5lGre-KWrFX1PwAnggf09Og4K_24K4GGAO16XhoCyS0QAvD_BwE) (or any tape is fine).

## Bonus tools and materials for prototyping

Some ideas for extra materials that could be useful to have around on the day:

Making materials:  
- General craft supplies, such as paper, scissors, felt or modelling clay  
- Sensual materials, such as feathers, fur, silk or textured fabrics  
- Moldable thermoplastics, eg [polymorph](https://schminkengrime.nl/boetseer-plastic-protoplast-100-polymorph?gclid=CjwKCAiA_9r_BRBZEiwAHZ_v10gb9osYb6Oy2arW4Rfp3eN-qjqRNBKK3pDkFyO6q6MjL5hHFeGbzxoC6ZYQAvD_BwE)
