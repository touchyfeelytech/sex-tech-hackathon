# Code of Conduct for Rainbows End ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ Sex Tech Hackathon

While this event is focused on sex and sexual behaviour, we want to approach it in a fair, positive and equal manner. We want everyone to feel comfortable and included in our environment. We DO want to encourage discussion and imagination around sex; we DONâ€™T want sexualised imagery.

The Rainbows End Sex Tech Hackathon's organising team are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, class or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers.

### Expected behaviours

We expect everyone to...

- Be welcoming, open and encouraging
- Treat everyone equally
- Respect privacy
- Respect personal identity
- Foster an inclusive environment, for example by using inclusive language
- Listen to differing viewpoints and experiences
- Be mindful of the needs and boundaries of others
- Foster an un-intimidating environment where people feel comfortable asking for help
- Be committed to help others where appropriate or when asked

### Unacceptable behaviours

- Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination [related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, class or religion]
- Posting sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Publishing of private communications without consent

- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate or unsolicited contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention

**If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.**

### Rules for online spaces
